This is my Mobile Applications project. It's an app where people can report holes, distorted guardrails and etc.
Whenever a user submits a new problem, the location of the device is automatically taken. This way whenever someone
touches a problem's photo, details are being show underneath it which include the location of the reported problem
and the first and last name of the user who has reported it. Also whenever they upload a new photo it's being stored
in Firebase S3 instead of the database. This way the DB is lighter because in column PHOTO it stores only a link to
the photo resource which then can be used access the image.

When developing this app, I've been using Android Studio's Pixel 2 emulator

MADE WITH REACT NATIVE, EXPO, SQLITE AND FIREBASE.
